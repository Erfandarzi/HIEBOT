For simplicity, let\'s consider a pH threshold of 7.0 to categorize the pH levels into two groups: low (≤ 7.0) and high (> 7.0).\n\nLet\'s categorize the data and calculate the odds ratio.\nTo calculate the odds ratio, we need to create a contingency table based on the categorized pH levels and MRI scores.\n\n1. **Categorize pH levels:**\n   - Low pH (≤ 7.0)\n   - High pH (> 7.0)\n\n2. **Categorize MRI scores:**\n   - Poor outcome (MRI score > 2)\n   - Good outcome (MRI score ≤ 2)\n\nLet\'s create the contingency table:\n\n|                | Poor Outcome (MRI score > 2) | Good Outcome (MRI score ≤ 2) |\n|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Low pH (≤ 7.0) |                              |                              |\n| High pH (> 7.0)|                              |                              |\n\nNow, let\'s fill in the table with the data we have:\n\n- Low pH (≤ 7.0):\n  - Poor Outcome: 0\n  - Good Outcome: 3 (LH087, LH098, LH025)\n\n- High pH (> 7.0):\n  - Poor Outcome: 1 (LH088)\n  - Good Outcome: 6 (LH088, LH092, LH092, LH094, LH099, LH025)\n\nThe contingency table will look like this:\n\n|                | Poor Outcome (MRI score > 2) | Good Outcome (MRI score ≤ 2) |\n|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Low pH (≤ 7.0) | 0                            | 3                            |\n| High pH (> 7.0)| 1                            | 6                            |\n\nNow, we can calculate the odds ratio (OR):\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{(a/c)}{(b/d)} = \\frac{(0/3)}{(1/6)} = 0 \\]\n\nThe odds ratio is 0, indicating that there is no observed association between low pH levels and poor outcomes in this sample.\n\nHere is the SQL query used:\n```sql\nSELECT m.subjectID, m.cordBloodGasPH, o.MRIScore \nFROM ""01-main"" m \nJOIN ""08-1-mri-overall"" o \nON m.subjectID = o.subjectID \nWHERE m.cordBloodGasPH IS NOT NULL \nAND o.MRIScore IS NOT NULL \nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n#errors:0'}","\nSELECT m.subjectID, m.cordBloodGasPH, o.MRIScore \nFROM ""01-main"" m \nJOIN ""08-1-mri-overall"" o \nON m.subjectID = o.subjectID \nWHERE m.cordBloodGasPH IS NOT NULL \nAND o.MRIScore IS NOT NULL \nLIMIT 10;\n",0,208,2,1
